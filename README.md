## Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! üòä

Please follow the steps below to run this project locally:

### Get started üöÄ

#### Requirements

-   PHP 8.x
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
-   A valid [Torchlight](https://torchlight.dev) token (free for non-profit open-source projects).


#### Setup

**STEP 1:**

Fork this repository, click on "Fork" in this page.

<br/>

**STEP 2:**

Clone your forked repository, run the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/docs wireui-docs && cd wireui-docs
```

<br/>

**STEP 3:**

WireUI Doc uses Torchlight to provide code highlighting.

Before continuing, you must register at [https://torchlight.dev](https://torchlight.dev) and get your access token.

The token will be required in the next step, and it should look like:

 ```bash
 torch_EFhVTgSra9HioAxtsK3ljnsj45BHmf
 ```

<br/>

**STEP 4:** 

In your project folder, execute the `run.sh` script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script automates the process of installing dependencies and set up the `.env` file.

### Doc syntax üìù

The WireUI Doc provides some components to facilitate the writing experience.

You are welcome to explore the code in the `resources/views/livewire/` folder to view real usage examples.

<br/>

#### Code snippets

Code snippets should always be included using the `<x-code>` tag.

The mandatory attributes are `language`, for the code language and the `contents`, for the code itself. Or use a `slot` instead of the `contents` attribute.


For example:

```php
//...
<x-code language="bash">
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag='wireui.config'
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag='wireui.resources'
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag='wireui.lang'
</x-code>
```

A copy button is loaded by default. To suppress the button, add the attribute: `copy="false"`.

Likewise, line numbers are displayed by default. To remove the numbers, add the attribute: `:line-numbers="false".

```php
<x-code no-copy :line-numbers="false" language="shell" :contents="Command exit with error error code xyz...." />
```

<br/>

#### Text mark

When giving instructions or using technical words, highlight important information with the `<x-mark>` tag.

For example, when using:

```php
Run <x-mark>npm install<x-mark> to install all to install all dependencies.
```

The outcome is similar to:

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

<br/>

#### Boxes

Sometimes it's crucial to highlight information such as a mandatory step or a compatibility issue. In these situations, you should use the `<x-alerts.warning>` tag, which will produce a yellow "attention" box.

For example:

```php
<x-alerts.warning>If you are using FooJS 1.0, you must configure bar=null before update.</x-alerts.warning>
```
In addition to that, if you need to provide a friendly message, a tip, or extra information, you should use of the `<x-alerts.info>` tag, which produces a blue info box.

```php
<x-alerts.info>Read more about supported formats <a href="#formats">here.</a></x-alerts.info>
```
